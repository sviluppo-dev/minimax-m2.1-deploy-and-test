Title: Research & Data Integrity Guidelines

Purpose
These guidelines describe expectations for experiment logging, reporting, and dashboard data to maintain trust, reproducibility, and ethical standards for this project.

Key principles
- Honesty: All reported experimental results must be generated by the described procedure. Do not fabricate runs, metrics, or logs.
- Reproducibility: Provide code, seeds, config, and instructions necessary to reproduce reported results where possible.
- Transparency: If placeholder or demo data is used, mark it clearly and keep it out of production branches and official artifacts.
- Security: Never commit secrets or credentials. If a script exposes secrets, rotate them immediately.

Practical rules
- Logging: Use W&B (or other experiment tracker) to log real runs. Tag runs with metadata (git commit, dataset, hyperparameters).
- Baselines: Only include baselines that are actually trained and evaluated. If a baseline is not available, state that explicitly and provide a plan to obtain it.
- Demos: Use synthetic or placeholder data only in demo branches or private demos; label them clearly and never present them as real.
- Violations: If you discover fabricated or falsified results, open an issue describing the artifact (technical facts only) and notify maintainers.

If you find a problem
1. Create an issue (factual, non-accusatory) linking to the offending commit/file and describing the specific problem.
2. Suggest remediation steps and help implement them if possible.
3. If the issue involves potential security leaks or personal data, contact maintainers privately and rotate credentials.

Contact
If you are unsure about a case, open an issue and tag @sviluppo-dev or other maintainers.
